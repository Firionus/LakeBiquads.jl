	Peak(f, dBGain, BWoct)

Return 96 kHz Biquad as DSP.SecondOrderSections that resembles Lake Peak EQ.

The algorithm is a modified version of the method first presented in:

Orfanidis, JAES 1997 Issue 6: "Digital Parametric Equalizer Design with Prescribed Nyquist-Frequency Gain"
http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=7854

In contrast to the method presented in the paper, this function does not
define linear Î”f based on Bandwidth but forces the level to be half of
dBGain at the lower Bandwidth-defining point, e. g. 1 octave down from f when
the Bandwidth is 2 octaves. The resulting Biquads correlated very well with
measured frequency responses from the Lake Controller.
